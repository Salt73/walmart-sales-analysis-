### Twelfth Graph
1. Different ranges of CPI have similar sales distributions.

## Inference
1. There is more revenue in holiday weeks.
2. December reported higher revenues.
3. The 14th store reported the highest annual sales.
4. Higher revenues were recorded when fuel prices and CPI were low, and the temperature was hot.

## Conclusion
- The year 2010 had the highest revenues, followed by 2011.
- The stores with the highest revenues are numbers 14, 20, and 4.
- Holidays generally have the highest revenues.
- Revenues are lower when the temperature is low and higher when the temperature is high.
- Revenues are higher when the CPI is low.
- Rising fuel prices do not seem to affect store revenues.
